# WIRED Validator

Wordpress post title and exceprt validator developed for WIRED, now available to the public! Adds Twitter-style validation for minimum and maximum lengths for your posts titles and excerpt. A counter in each field will indicate how many characters user has left to type, turning when red when there are too few or too many. Also adds minimum length checking on user bios on user update. Lastly adds recommended image minimum width for featured images in posts.

~NOTE:~ No validation in this plugin is "hard" validation. In other words this plugin simply warns a user if they've not met one of the validation rules. In the case of post titles and excerpts this happens in real time via the counter. Other fields simply output a warning in the messages area of the dashboard (at the top of the screen).

## Adjusting Settings
This plugin adds a custom setting page once enabled which allows you to override the default minimum/maximum settings for title and exceprt (20/80 and 40/140 respecitvely). User bio minimum is 140 by default while featured image minimum width recomendation defaults to 1000px.
